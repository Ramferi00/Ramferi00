# üë®‚Äçüíª About Me:
I am Ramferi, a Computer Systems Engineering student with a strong interest in technological development. I am dedicating myself to learning front-end web development, acquiring solid foundations and skills through personal projects.

Later on, I am interested in delving into the field of artificial intelligence, an area I consider to have enormous potential to transform many aspects of our daily lives.

My professional goal is to apply and expand my skills in real-world projects, contributing to creating innovative and effective solutions. My self-taught approach to learning, continuous improvement, and a proactive attitude towards problem-solving are some of the qualities that define me.

Despite still being in the early stages of my career in the technology field, I am determined to move forward quickly and face significant challenges. I invite you to explore my repositories to get a more precise idea of my skills and projects.

I am open to new opportunities and especially interested in collaborating on projects that have a real impact. Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you believe I could be a valuable asset to your team or project.
