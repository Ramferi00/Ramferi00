#👨‍💻 About Me:
Hi, I'm Ramferi, a student of Computer Systems Engineering with a great interest in technological advances. I am currently focusing on learning cybersecurity, acquiring solid skills through personal projects ranging from threat analysis to the implementation of protection and security measures.

In the future, I am interested in delving deeper into the field of artificial intelligence, an area that I believe has enormous potential to transform many aspects of our daily lives.

My professional goal is to apply and expand my knowledge in cybersecurity in real-world projects, contributing to create innovative and effective security solutions. My self-taught approach to learning, continuous improvement and a proactive attitude towards problem solving are some of the qualities that define me.
